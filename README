## Noisebox

a synth for the raspberry pi (and Akai LPD8)
This should work with the debian squeeze and jessie distro for raspberry pi,
and x86.

The only thing you need to install is libasound2-dev:
```
sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev
```

to build noisebox, cd into the folder, and type ```make```
Let me know if there's any problems!

Usage:
```
./noisebox [sound card number]
```
_Sound card number_: an integer identifiyng the sound card, by default the first sound device is selected,
to list all de available devices use aplay.

```
aplay --list-devices
```
